Trajectory Optimization for non-smooth systems using the idea of (randomized) smoothing.

To get started, create environment using:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Animations

Below are GIF animations (from `results/animations`) demonstrating optimization results.

- 1D Box Push — 1D box constrained to move along a single axis with dry Coulomb friction
